# AI STR Query Responder - Product Requirements

When working on this project, always reference and consider the Product Requirements Document (PRD) located at `docs/prd.md`. This document contains the complete specification for the AI STR Query Responder application.

## Key Project Context:

- **Purpose**: AI-powered WhatsApp Business autoresponder for short-term rental (STR) properties
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, Supabase, Vercel AI SDK, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Stripe
- **Core Features**: WhatsApp integration, property management, AI response generation, subscription payments
- **Target Users**: STR property managers/hosts with 1-50 properties

## Always Consider:

1. **Architecture decisions** should align with the PRD's technical requirements
2. **Feature implementations** should match the specified user flows and functionality
3. **UI/UX choices** should serve the target user personas (Busy Host, Property Manager)
4. **Security and compliance** requirements as outlined in the PRD
5. **Performance targets** (response time <5s, 100 messages/minute capacity)

When making any code changes, feature additions, or architectural decisions, ensure they align with the goals, scope, and requirements defined in the PRD.
